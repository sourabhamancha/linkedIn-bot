# LinkedIn Bot

#Functionality 1

The bot takes a job role and a location as inputs, and searches for the LinkedIn related jobs.

A dataframe is created with all these job roles names, their companies, respective dates of these jobs posted and the linkedin links of these jobs.

The bot then sends a customized HTML email with the created dataframe attached to it.

#Functionality 2

The bot takes in an integer input 'n', that accepts a maximun value of 40. In case of 'n' > 40, then 'n' is set to 40.

The bot then automatically sends out requests to 'n' suggested people.
